# Project PRD Rule

## Scope

- This repo is Arduino-only. Keep work centered on:
  - `arduino/JC4827W543_LVGLv9/JC4827W543_LVGLv9.ino`
  - `arduino/I2C_Pin_Scanner_BME280/I2C_Pin_Scanner_BME280.ino`
  - supporting files in `scripts/` and `README.md`
- Do not reintroduce ESP-IDF/CMake project structure unless explicitly requested.

## Hardware and Sensor Constraints

- BME280 communication uses I2C on `GPIO17` (SDA) and `GPIO18` (SCL).
- BME280 address is `0x77` unless user explicitly asks to support another address.
- Preserve live UI behavior: readable values, visible scales, and working brightness control.

## Implementation Expectations

- Keep UI changes high-contrast on dark backgrounds.
- Prefer concise, incremental edits; avoid broad refactors unless requested.
- Validate by building/flashing with project scripts after meaningful firmware changes.

## Documentation Rules

- Keep `README.md` aligned with current scripts and repo structure.
- Include a Table of Contents in markdown files created or substantially updated.
